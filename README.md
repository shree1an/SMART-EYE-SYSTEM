# SMART-EYE-SYSTEM

Smart Eye System is an efficient, motion-triggered surveillance solution built using ESP32-CAM, PIR sensor, and servo motors. When motion is detected, the system captures images to avoid storing hours of empty footage. 
It also features a web interface that allows users to remotely control the camera’s direction — left, right, up, and down — using servo motors. 
This makes the system flexible, storage-efficient, and ideal for smart home or small security setups with real-time manual control.
